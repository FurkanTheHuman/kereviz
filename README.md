# Kereviz

Kereviz is designed for running background tasks in Python programs. Especialy for API's like flask or fastapi. It is a single process/node version of Celery (kereviz means celery in Turkish). It is good for io bound tasks.   

## State of the project
Kereviz currently in development stage. So there aren't any docs. Stay tuned.      
However, the most of the basic functionality is implemented.
